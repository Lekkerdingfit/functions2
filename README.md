This is my last project5: Functions

Problem 🌞
I like tanning—there’s something about sun-warmed skin that just feels good. But I also know UV rays can be damaging, especially when you’re exposed without realizing how strong the sun actually is. I’ve often found myself wondering, “Is it safe to tan right now? Am I just getting golden… or burnt?” Most UV apps feel too clinical or boring, and it’s hard to connect a number like “UV 8” with what that actually means for your skin in real life.

Solution 🍞
So I built something that makes UV awareness simple, playful, and visual—by comparing UV levels to toast.

- The toast visuals show how "done" your skin could get under current UV conditions—ranging from soft bread to burnt toast.
- You can search your location and select the time to see the UV forecast.
- Instead of boring warnings, it gives friendly nudges like:
“Today’s toast level: golden brown. Don’t forget SPF and sunscreen!”
- Based on the UV level, it also recommends wearing sunglasses or applying sunscreen
